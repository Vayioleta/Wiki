Absolutely, here are the steps to deploy a Docker Compose setup for your Minecraft server:

### Deploying Docker Compose for Minecraft Server

#### Prerequisites:

1. **Docker:** Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from [Get Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

#### Steps to Deploy Docker Compose:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the repository containing the `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` for your Minecraft server.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vayioleta/Docker-Minecraft-Server
   cd Minecraft-Server
   ```

2. **Customization (Optional):**

   - *Dockerfile Configuration*: If required, make specific adjustments to the `Dockerfile` within the cloned directory to configure the server according to your preferences.

3. **Deploy Docker Compose:**

   Execute the following command to start the Minecraft server using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   - The `-d` flag runs the containers in the background, allowing you to free up the terminal while the server continues running.

4. **Access the Minecraft Server:**

   Once the server is up and running, you can access the game by using the Minecraft client. Open the game and connect to the server at `localhost:3000` or `your-server-ip:3000`.

With these steps, you'll be able to deploy a Minecraft server using Docker Compose quickly and easily. Ensure you've made any necessary configurations or adjustments in the `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile` before deploying the server.
